# auto-amigo-react

## About

Auto Amigo is your car friend. This is the React version.

This is Lisa's side project to try new tech and play around.

### Current Features

- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
- This uses Google OAuth using [next-auth](https://next-auth.js.org/).
- Users can create a log of their gas usage and spending. When they go to the gas station, they enter their previous mileage, current mileage, gallons filled, and the price per gallon. It will give them their MPG and total spent.
- User can delete an entry from their gas log.

For more things to come, please see the [Issues](https://github.com/Zhusufeng/auto-amigo-react/issues) in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Zhusufeng/auto-amigo-react).

## Deployment

TBD

<!-- The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details. -->
